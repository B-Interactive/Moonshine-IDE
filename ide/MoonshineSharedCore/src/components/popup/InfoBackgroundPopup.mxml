						<s:p>"Andromeda On The Rocks" - This image, performed on July 8th 2013, is the result of a careful and resourceful planning work carried out together with the friend Paolo Bolognini, a very good photographer from Ancona. With him and another friend who gave us a hand with the equipment, we arrived by sea, a bit like pirates, near the cove of the "Due Sorelle", at the foot of Monte Conero, near Ancona. The expedition was organized in order to bring the material necessary for both shooting and overnight on this almost inaccessible place. The alternative to the sea was a difficult and dangerous path that would not have allowed us to bring all the equipment. Arrived on this pristine place we spent the whole night photographing the fantastic landscape from the sunset, and then continue at night with the starry sky. The orientation of the place, facing south-east but with the south completely hidden from behind Monte Conero, did not allow the classic framing of the core of the Milky Way, so I tried to give a different meaning to the composition of the image, inserting in the center of the celestial part the constellation of Andromeda with visible the known galaxy M31, which like all the amateur astronomers know is the most distant object visible to the naked eye. The resulting image travels along the entire distance scale accessible to the human eye: from the stones at the bottom, on the water's edge, to continue to the sea horizon, and continue towards the stars of our galaxy up to the galaxy of Andromeda, more than 2.5 million light years. This type of photography, which I call "astro-landscape", has the ability to make the immensity of the sky more "human", allowing us to compare the dimensions of the terrestrial elements to the infinite distances of the universe. Just this feature of extreme extension of the distance scale inspired the APOD selector, who chose it as an image of the day on September 27, 2013. Later it was revived on April 19, 2016. "Andromeda On The Rocks" is certainly my most famous photo, and I particularly care about this type of images because I think that Italy is a mine of possible sources of inspiration for similar images, which portray the beauty of our landscapes under the unusual light of the starry sky. In this regard it is important to remember that the starry sky must be respected as well as the natural environment. Italy unfortunately has a shape that lends itself to avoiding light pollution, being a nation not very extensive and very densely populated. Nevertheless I think we can do much more with a sensitization towards this problem, very few tricks could greatly improve things. What we are canceling with lighting that is often excessive or badly used is a heritage that our children will have to give up. Precisely for this reason, whenever possible, I also try to take my 5 year old son under the starry mountain skies, before the situation gets even worse. I often make out about astrophotography: it is really alarming to see that almost all people under the age of 20 do not even know what the Milky Way is! And this is very serious for me, it's a bit 'like never having seen the sea, not being aware of where we live, where we are and how much we are small on board this leaflet that we call Earth in the middle of the ocean that is the Universe ...
